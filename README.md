# Flat_plate_SAH
Modelling and dynamic simulation of different flat plate solar air heaters with the codes developed using MATLAB. The solar radiation is the heat source for the process and is considered as varying with respect to time. The number of glazings and aperture height are the different geometric parameters, and mass flow rate is the operating parameter considered to conduct the parametric study in the present work. 
The variation in temperature of each part of SAH, efficiency and the outlet air temperature are simulated.
To find the temperature distribution of all elements, the energy balance equations are discretized using a finite difference scheme and solved.
